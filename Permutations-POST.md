<p>As seen in the video, Ezran (the little kid) presses a bunch of stones on a wall, while calling it a stone or a rock (what's the difference anyway, though?). Don't call me acerbic, but I must say, it is amusing to watch him be intelligent enough to remember that combination along with stone/rock, but not smart or hygienic enough to wipe off or AT LEAST lick off the jelly on his hands. UGH! <br>Coming back to the story, we see Rayla (the elf) effortlessly, cracking the combination, allegedly by "pressing all the stones with jelly handprints". If that's so, then there are only two explanations: <b>(i) The security to that secret chamber is compromised </b>as hell, which is unlikely, or <b>(ii) Rayla got handsomely lucky</b> (or beautifully lucky, in her case). </p>
<p>Here's why: </p>
<p>The lock consisted of pressing <b>9</b> rocks, in a specific series, while calling it with a specific name: Rock or Stone. Since Rayla was very clear that she pressed the stones with jelly handprints, she knew the rocks to be presesd. All she had to do was get the order right. Also, for the sake of proving Rayla's luck, let us assume that each rock had to be presesd only once.</p>
<p>This is similar to a situation where you know the digits of a number lock but do not know the order. Consider this keypad: </p>

<p> (Consider the password to this lock to be <b>8461</b>).</p><p> To make the situation similar to the one at present, we can know the digits to be pressed.  
These are the digits requried to open the lock: 1, 4, 6, and 8. We arrive at a point to prove Rayla's insane luck already: Just knowing the digits is not enough. We need the specific order of the digits in the lock.<br><br> For instance, these are the different numbers we can get using these digits alone: </p>
<table>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>1468</td><td>4168</td><td>6148</td><td>8146</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1486</td><td>4186</td><td>6184</td><td>8164</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1648</td><td>4618</td><td>6418</td><td>8416</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1684</td><td>4681</td><td>6481</td><td><font color="green"><b>8461</b></font></td></tr>
      <tr><td>1846</td><td>4816</td><td>6814</td><td>8614</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1864</td><td>4861</td><td>6841</td><td>8641</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>From the table, it can be observed that the <text class="number">8461</text> is <text class="number">1</text> of the </text class="number"> 24 </text> different combinations that can be obtained by shuffling the digits.  </p>
