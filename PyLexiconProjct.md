<p>This is a Python Program, which takes in a list/series of words as inputs, then processes the words/runs the program to fetch the Definition, Part of Speech, & Example sentence (if any) for the word. This then gathers these pieces of information for all the entered words, finally compiling all of them into an excel sheet.</p>
<p>Here is a video showing the working of this program:</p>
