Physics is the branch of science that seeks to understand the fundamental laws of nature. It explores how the universe behaves—from the tiniest particles like quarks and electrons to the vastness of galaxies and black holes. Physics explains motion, forces, energy, matter, space, and time. Whether it’s why the sky is blue, how a rocket launches, or what keeps planets in orbit, physics is behind it all. It’s not just about formulas—it's about curiosity, discovery, and uncovering the hidden patterns that govern reality.
