<p>I GOT MY ARDUINO!!</p>
<p>Yessir, I got my Arduino a month ago, and I am having a lot of fun with it! I still don't have any impressive projects or anything impressive at all, but still, I am having fun integrating coding with hardware or electronics. The first two days, felt absolutely brutal - No proper program, and being clumsy at everything, being unable to remember the simplset of syntax... BUTT, here I am now, having fun with everything that I'm doing - connecting hardware to breadboards, and writing programs to control them, taking in inputs using that hardware, and whatnot!</p>
<p>The real challenge began on the day my desire for learning robotics started - choosing between Raspberry Pi and Arduino. Raspberry Pi was a whole computer, Arduino is just a processor. But after DEEEEP research using AI and the internet, I found Arduino most suitable for my stage right now - introduction to robotics and electronics. Raspberry Pi seemed to be more useful for advanced robotics programmers. </p>
<p>The next challenge, as humorous as it sounds, was choosing WHICH Arduino board to choose - again, many options! So I went through each board, asked AI and YouTube, and found that Arduino UNO R4 Minima most suitable - both for my introductory phase, and my pocket (my brother's pocket in fact). I faced yet another challenge - which starter kit to buy. The official kit is unreal-level expensive. So, I had to go for generic kits. And thus began my least favourite chore - Searching for stuff. Then I managed to find a starter kit, worth the money, with the official R4 Minima board. Luckily, third time's a charm, so this was the final challenge - until my Arduino arrived. </p>
<p>The first day I got my Arduino, I was baffled - where to start, which is the proper way to learn it, and all. I watched many YouTube videos on how to start, and the official documentation of the board too is pretty vast, so you don't get where exactly to start. So, the first two days, the progress I achieved was close to nothing - because I read unnecessary (though informative) stuff, within the documentation. But then I got my calling - connect stuff up and code the parts to do whatever, and that's when my real, noticeable progress started. I reffered </p>
