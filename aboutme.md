About Me
I'm a passionate and intellectually curious student with a strong interest in physics, mathematics, computer science, and robotics. I'm currently in Class 10 and aspire to study at MIT someday. I enjoy exploring how things work, often diving deep into concepts rather than just memorizing them. I balance gaming and studies well, and I’ve been learning Python and machine learning, while also preparing for Olympiads and academic competitions. While I'm a bit introverted at first, I open up once I get comfortable. I’m also creative—I write, build projects, and enjoy expressing myself through visuals and personal websites.
