<p>Welcome to the Bucket List page! As the name suggests, here is where I make a list of things that I must absolutely do during my lifetime. <br>(In case you're wondering, I could have just inserted this link into the About Me page but then I had to think where to insert it and all which seemed pretty boring. IT. STAYS. HERE. lol)</p>
