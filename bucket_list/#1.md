<p>
Okay, first off I'll admit it that it's weird for me to explain a bucket-list goal of my life. It's usually just a simple thing like "Play in a beach for an entire day" or something shorter, most commonly. But not the first thing on my list!
</p>
<p>It's a combo; a wild one at that -->
<br>(All this in Norway): 
<br>i. Hop on an aeroplane (the one in which paragliding is done), <br>ii. Enjoy the northern lights, <br>iii. Jump out the plane to paraglide WHILE the northern lights dance above me, <br>iv. Land on a snow-capped mountain, <br>v. Ski from the top of the mountain to the bottom, <br>vi. Run upto the beach, vii. finally, cannonball into the beach without thinking twice (yes, in the cold, freezing water). 
</p>
<p>Alright, this seemed more real in my head. Impossible? nahh... Just waiting...</p>

<p>Where did I get this idea out of nowhere? Well, when I was watching Limitless (w/ Chris Hemsworth) on National Geographic and saw such a place where my two favourite elements of nature co-existed: In Norway - Snow, and the sea. </p>

<p>So, yup. This is my crazy, weird #1 To-Do on my bucket list as soon as I grow old and become financially stable. </p>
