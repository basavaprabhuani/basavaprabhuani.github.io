<p>
Okay, first off I'll admit it that it's weird for me to <i>explain</i> a bucket-list goal of my life. It's usually just a simple thing like "Play in a beach for an entire day" or something shorter, most commonly. But not the first thing on my list!
</p>
<p>It's a combo; a wild one at that -->
<ol>
    <li>Hop on an aeroplane (the kind used for paragliding).</li>
    <li>Enjoy the northern lights.</li>
    <li>Jump out of the plane to paraglide while the northern lights dance above me.</li>
    <li>Land on a snow-capped mountain.</li>
    <li>Ski from the top of the mountain to the bottom.</li>
    <li>Run up to the beach.</li>
    <li>Finally, cannonball into the beach without thinking twice (yes, in the cold, freezing water).</li>
</ol>

</p>
<p>Alright, this seemed more real in my head. Impossible? nahh... Just waiting...</p>

<p>Where did I get this idea out of nowhere? Well, when I was watching Limitless (w/ Chris Hemsworth) on National Geographic and saw such a place where my two favourite elements of nature co-existed: In Norway - Snow, and the sea. </p>

<p>So, yup. This is my crazy, weird #1 To-Do on my bucket list as soon as I grow old and become financially stable. </p>
