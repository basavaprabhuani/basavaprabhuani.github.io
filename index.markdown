<h3>HEY THERE!!!</h3>

Iâ€™m Basavaprabhu Ani, alias experi_mentalkid (am I still a kid?) and this little corner of the internet is my way of putting all my ideas, projects, and daydreams in one place. Think of it as a digital scrapbook of what Iâ€™m learning, building, and exploring â€” with a healthy dash of curiosity and a spark of fun along the way.
I like to think of 06/07/2010 as the day on which a legend (hopefully) was born; 'cuz that's when I was born ðŸ˜Š. 

<h3>About Me</h3>
I spend a major part of my time (more than 60%) in academics-the usual (and boring) school, but mostly FUN Science & Math. While I find Science & Math highly entertaining, unfortunately "that's not everything in life". So, to pass my time while having fun and educating myself at the same time, I do many other things as well, which brings us to the topic of my hobbies.

Doing many activities are enjoyed by me - Coding, watching movies & playing games (but then again, who doesn't enjoy this), digging up for the reasons for many natural phenomena within the body and the universe to quench my curiosity, to name a few. I learnt how to code (in python) when I was of age 11, primarily because I had seen my brother, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/allamaprabhu-ani/">Allamaprabhu Ani</a>, using VBA, another coding language, to automate some tedious tasks of mine which I had to do as a part of my academics on the computer (like writing down the meanings of new words I come across in my textbooks in excel). Events like these ignited my curiosity into learning how to code and implement that knowledge into automating my own tedious tasks of day-to-day life on the computer (FYI I have also attached my own version of the program mentioned above, which I had written using Python, on GitHub). Though I haven't really written many programs to serve the aforementioned purpose, I have certainly written programs as a pass-time. Programming has genuinely enhanced my logically-thinking skills as, one has to use one's brain to write a program. <br>
Coming to my less-important hobbies, i.e., watching movies and playing games, I love action movies but mostly sci-fi ones like Iron Man, Interstellar or any other movies which could be the potential future of Humanity and the Earth. For action movies, my go-to would be anything similar to John Wick. But mostly, I focus on watching either Sci-Fi (which cover up for 60% of the movies I watch), or humorous ones. And oh! how could I forget!? YOUNG SHELDON. I kinda feel both him and I are the same, but neither am I insanely condescending nor am I as knowledgable (mind me, 'knowledgable', not smart) as him. 
<br>
Definitely not to boast, but my hold over the English grammar and vital parts of it-including composition- is proficient. So proficient, that my brother genuinely seeks my approval of an important document that he has written, which he would need to submit officially, not for his English is worse, but for he believes I am proficient and critical in the usage of correct grammar and puncuation. <br>
Not only English, but I speak 4 other langues - Kannada, Hindi, Tamil, and French (broken, but manageable). Sadly, however, I am forced to be the "Jack of all trades, Master of ONE". I guess that still makes me a polyglot ðŸ˜Ž. 
<br>
When it comes to music, I can play the flute-at least the basics-which is definitely not something notable, since all I can play are the <i>sargam</i>. I definitely want to build up my flute skills, for I do not want to be 'that nerd kid' or 'the booky-guy'. <br>
Not only music of mine, but I do love pop music of my favourite artists - Taylor Swift, Pitbull & The Weeknd, to name a few. One might say that the music I play and the music I listen to are of stark contrast. 

<h4>My Aim</h4>
Here comes the most important part of this whole blog - MY AIM (mind it, not a 'dream' but an AIM). 
I aspire to become a phycisist, because I have been fascinated by the astonishing, yet logical and systematic, reasons for various phenomena in the universe, like why the Earth goes around the sun, why doesn't a person on the south-pole fall down into the vast universe (which is kinda silly, but still thought-provoking), and why the sky is never blue at the time of sunset or sunrise. 
Before becoming a physicist, I need to study in a university (I bet you didn't know that ðŸ˜‚). And for this, I want to study in MIT - that's right, the place where Tony Stark studied (I know he's ficitonal. Just Saying.). My efforts are 100% into getting into MIT, and I am definitely not joking about this. I am seriously diligent and determined to become worthy of studying in MIT, by hook or crook. 
I want to study in MIT, because that's the place where problems are solved, and innovations are made. I'm not saying stuff like that doesn't happen in other universities, but it's at MIT, where you get to collaborate with people of various backgrounds and therefore have fresh thoughts and ideas on solving the world's problems. <br>To be completely honest, that's not all that inspires me-it's also the pride of being able to study in #1 University of the world, by being the best-of-the-best. 

That's all About Me. 


Further, in this website of mine, I will be consistently adding new stuff about things that I discover-primarily regarding Science & Math, and computer-science as well, to some extent, and you can find these posts in-you guessed it-the Posts section at the bottom of the page (A direct link to 'Posts' has been provided in the top right corner as well).
