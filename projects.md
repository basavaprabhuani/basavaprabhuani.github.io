<p>Welcome to Projects - my little corner of creativity. This is where ideas turn into code, concepts transform into experiments, and curiosity finds its way into something tangible. Think of it as a gallery of “what happens when imagination meets STEM.”</p><p>Not every project here is meant to be groundbreaking or world-changing. Instead, these early builds are my stepping stones — a log of how I learn, experiment, and grow over time.</p><p>Each project here has its own story — sometimes inspired by a random thought, sometimes by a challenge I set for myself, and often by the joy of learning something new. Some are playful, some practical, but all are built with the same spirit: to explore, to create, and to keep pushing the boundaries of what I can do.</p>
<p>So dive in, click around, and enjoy the journey!</p>
